# VEHICLE_PRIORITISING_USING_RFID_READER_MODULE


Traffic congestion represents a major problem for most urban areas. 
This project presents a traffic control system to pass emergency   
vehicles smoothly. In these days we know that the traffic is more in the
rush hours and we may be struck  in the traffic for a while. Where coming to the 
point in the case of emergency vehicles like ambulances, VIP vehicles also may wait
in the traffic for a long time. This may also lead to loss of human lives 
because of not reaching their destinations in proper time. The suggested 
system considers active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and GSM technologies. 


Each individual vehicle is equipped with special radio frequency identification (RFID) tag.
We use RFID reader, ARM system-on-chip to read the RFID tags of the vehicle.
It also determines the network congestion, and hence the green light duration for that path. 
If the RFID-tag-read belongs to the stolen vehicle, then an alarm is raised and 
then the nearby police will get alerted. We also have traffic control for the VIP vehicles.
